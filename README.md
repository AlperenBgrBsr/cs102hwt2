CS102 Homework 2,
An array program to create an array and do some calculations based on it. Then, a menu is displayed the user unless the user enters (q). The menu asks different operations. 
1. Find maximum: a method to find the maximum number of the array.
2. Find minimum: a method to find the minimum number of the array.
3. Find average: a method to find the average of all the numbers. We choosed it to return a double to prevent data loss in floating point numbers.
4. Display differences from average: a method to find differences of all number between the average.
5. Find the sum of elements with odd and even numbered indexes: a method to find the sum of odd and even numbered indexes. Starts with index 0 which is even.

Added some error catching places in asking for size in array. Also the prevention of data loss is added.
Have a nice day!
